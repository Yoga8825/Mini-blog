            <p>|Chennai, formerly known as Madras, is the capital city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India.<br>
                 It is the state's primate city and is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal.<br>
                 According to the 2011 Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban agglomeration.
                 Incorporated in 1688, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in India and the second oldest in the world after London.</p>

                <p>Chennai is a major centre for medical tourism and is termed "India's health capital".<br>
                     Chennai houses a major portion of India's automobile industry, hence the name "Detroit of India".<br>
                      It was the only South Asian city to be ranked among National Geographic's "Top 10 food cities" in 2015<br>
                       and ranked ninth on Lonely Planet's best cosmopolitan cities in the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major film production centre and home to the Tamil-language film industry.</p>
